To create Python code for AI-generated music composition using generative AI techniques. 

This example leverages: 
    Music21: for handling music theory and MIDI output. 
    TensorFlow/Keras: for training a simple neural network. 
    NumPy: for data processing. 
 
This code will create a LSTM-based sequence generator for simple melodies.

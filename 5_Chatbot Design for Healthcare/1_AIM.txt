Designing an ethical chatbot for healthcare using OpenAI's tools involves ensuring the system is: 
    Privacy-aware (compliant with HIPAA or relevant laws) 
    Transparent (discloses it is an AI, not a medical professional) 
    Helpful, not harmful (avoids diagnosis, offers general support) 
    Fallback-aware (refers to a human or emergency help if needed)
